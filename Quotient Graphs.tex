\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}

The automorphism group of a graph induces a partition of the vertex set into orbits of its action on the graph. Intuitively, we think of the vertices in one orbit as being ``automorphically equivalent". It is natural, therefore, to define the \emph{quotient graph} with respect to the automorphism and study its relation to the original graph. Formally, if $\Gamma$ is a graph with automorphism group $G$, and $\mathcal \Pi$ is the partition of the vertex set $V(G)$ into orbits under the action of $G$, then the quotient graph $\Gamma/G$ has $\Pi$ as its vertex set, and any two distinct vertices $X$ and $Y$ of $\Gamma/G$ are adjacent whenever there are vertices $x$ and $y$ of $\Gamma$ such that $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.

\begin{Definition}
If $\Gamma$ is a graph with automorphism group $\aut \Gamma = G$, the quotient graph of $G$ is the graph $\Gamma' = \Gamma/G$ having vertex set
\begin{equation*}
V(\Gamma') = \{\, X \mid X = \orb_G(x), \exists x \in V(\Gamma) \,\}
\end{equation*}
and edge set 
\begin{equation*}
E(\Gamma') = \{\, (X,Y) \mid X = \orb_G(x), Y = \orb_G(y), X \ne Y, \exists x, y \in V(G) \,\}.
\end{equation*}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Lemma}
\label{lem:xy=>x'y'}
If $X$ and $Y$ are two orbits of the automorphism group of a graph $\Gamma$, and a vertex $x \in X$ is adjacent to a vertex $y \in Y$, then every vertex $x'$ of $X$ is adjacent to some vertex of $Y$.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $x' \in X$. Since $X = \orb(x)$ is the orbit of $x$ under the automorphism group of $\Gamma$, there is some automorphism $\varphi$ of $\Gamma$ such that $\varphi(x) = x'$. Then, $\varphi(y) = y'$, $\exists y' \in Y = \orb(y)$. Since $x \adj{} y$, it follows that $x' \adj{} y'$, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{Theorem}
\label{thm:CycCorr}
Every cycle in the quotient graph $\Gamma' = \Gamma/G$ of a graph $G$ corresponds to a cycle in the graph $\Gamma$.
\end{Theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k$ be a cycle of length $k$ in the quotient graph $\Gamma'$. Then, $X_1 \adj{\Gamma'} X_2$ implies that there exist vertices $x_1 \in X_1$ and $x_2 \in X_2$ of $\Gamma$, with $x_1 \adj{\Gamma} x_2$. Again, $X_2 \adj{\Gamma'} X_3$ implies that $x'_2 \adj{\Gamma} x'_3$, for some vertices $x'_2 \in X_2$ and $x'_3 \in X_3$. But then by Lemma~\ref{lem:xy=>x'y'}, $x_2$ itself is adjacent to some vertex $x_3 \in X_3$, in $\Gamma$. Similarly, we may find a sequences of vertices $x_4, x_5, \ldots, x_k$, such that $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$ is a path in $\Gamma$. Now, since $X_k \adj{\Gamma'} X_1$, we must have $x_k \adj{\Gamma} y_1$, for some vertex $y_1 \in X_1$. If $y_1 = x_1$, we obtain a cycle as required. If not, we proceed as before to find a vertex $y_2 \in X_2$, with $y_1 \adj{\Gamma} y_2$, and so on, thus obtain a longer path in $\Gamma$ consisting of vertices of the orbits $X_1, \ldots, X_k$. As there are finitely many vertices, this procedure terminates at a repeated vertex, and we obtain a cycle in $\Gamma$.
\end{proof}
