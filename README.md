# Quotient Graphs

The quotient graph of a simple, undirected graph is defined (as given [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/140229/automorphism-group-action-leads-to-a-quotient-graph) and [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/140796/embedding-of-a-quotient-graph)) by partitioning the vertex set into orbits under the action of the automorphism group of the graph. The process of quotienting results in a smaller graph, unless the original graph is [identity graph](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IdentityGraph.html). Naturally, we can define a sequence of quotient graphs starting from a given graph and ending in an identity graph. The sequence will be of length 1 exactly when the original graph is an identity graph. Any [vertex transitive graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex-transitive_graph) will have a sequence of length 2, with the trivial graph of order 1 as the terminal graph. The converse is also true, although other graphs can also have sequences of length 2, with non-trivial identity graphs as terminal graphs.
